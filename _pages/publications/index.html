In 2015, the U.S. Department of Transportation introduced the Smart City Challenge to support and incentivize mid-sized cities nationwide to upgrade their infrastructure. San Francisco City, one of the seven finalists, used part of the funds to expand SFpark, a "smart-parking" program, to the city's 28,000 on-street parking meters in early 2018. The primary objective of SFpark was to ensure that curb parking accommodates as many customers as possible for the adjacent businesses. By applying dynamic difference-in-differences methods, I find that SFpark positively impacts the growth rate in the number of businesses in the affected block groups. The positive effect is lessened in areas with a higher ratio of people and businesses per meter. </div> </body></html>
