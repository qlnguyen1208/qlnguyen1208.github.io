Hi there! I recently graduated from the University of California, San Diego, with a bachelor's degree in Mathematics and Economics. I have a strong math background in calculus, probability, and statistics with RStudio, STATA, and Python. I am very passionate about economic growth, finance, and business analysis. Regarding the research sector, I am excited to study and do research in international macroeconomics, economic development, and R&D.
